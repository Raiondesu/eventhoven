## What is this?
It's a simple type-safe event manager library for browser and node, less than 1KB (gzipped).

It provides a powerful set of tools for creating and composing event managers.\
In other words, it manages event managers!

A main list of features includes (but not limited to):
- Full tree-shaking
- Functional-style API
- Multiple event arguments
- Event names can also be symbols (private events)
- Versatile plugin system (using [meta-events](#meta-events))
- Fully type-safe - each event-map remembers its event names and type signature (no need for hacky enums)
- All functions are curried and point-free, which makes them easier to use in functional environment
  (for example, with [`ramda`](https://github.com/ramda/ramda) and similar tools)
- **SOLID**
  - **S**RP - every function does only one thing
  - **O**CP - HOFs allow to change certain behaviours without the need to rewrite code
  - **L**SP - all funcions are easily substitutable using dependency injection
    as long as they adhere to the same API
  - **I**SP - all data types are the least specific versions of them
  - **D**IP - API depends only on abstractions
- Code-generation-friendly:\
  Due to the SRP, all functions have a very limited number of ways of invocation.\
  This allows to automatically generate efficient code (for example, CRUD events) for this library without concerns about its stability.
- **KISS** and **DRY**

## Disclaimer
> and some ground principles

### TypeScript

`eventhoven`'s main concern is type-safety at every step,
so all the code examples will be written in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

It was written in a "type-first, implementation-later" way,
and will be kept that way to ensure that runtime types always match the static ones.

### Currying

"Why curry functions?" you may ask. Great question! It has many answers on the web already, but I'd recommend reading [this](https://medium.com/@iquardt/currying-the-underestimated-concept-in-javascript-c95d9a823fc6) and [this](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/ch04.html).

`eventhoven` uses the concept of currying to elevate the abstraction
and allow for a much wider and precise usage of it's API in return for sometimes writing `)(` instead of usual `, `,
which is not too much of a price to pay for this feature.

It also allows `eventhoven` to be used effortlessly with other functional libraries like [`ramda`](https://github.com/ramda/ramda) and many others.

Not all `eventhoven` function are curried. Those, which are, however, will have the following disclaimer:

> Note, that the function is [curried](#currying), which means that it must be called partially

### External state >>> Internal state

`eventhoven` doesn't store anything internally, it's a completely stateless, pure and side-effect-free library.\
It only has side-effects from closures on an *external* state that a user provides.\
So, there it is - no private fields, no hidden implementation details, no complications.\
This allows for easier testing *and* simpler usage.

Thanks to this rule, `eventhoven` is a higher abstraction above other event-managers. A Higher-Order-Event-Manager, if you like.\
That is, any other event manager's API can be built on top of what `eventhoven` gives you, providing a nearly endless set of possibilities.

### OK, but why not %event-manager-package%?

`eventhoven` is not in direct comparison to other event managers.
As stated in the main description - its main purpose is to **compose** events and event managers.

In production, it's a fairly typical scenario that multiple libraries
with multiple event systems exist and function in the same project at the same time.\
Front-end libraries do that all the time - `vue`, `react`, `angular` - all have own separate event systems - even from the DOM!
`eventhoven` aims to provide a connecting bridge for different event managing strategies,
by **providing instruments** for unifying the event management API.\
In other words, it allows to **unify** event management.

It just so happens that it can do event management very efficiently too. üòâ

## Installation

**npm**:
```bash
npm i -S eventhoven
```

**module**: see [importing](#importing)

Currently, only installation through [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eventhoven) or `script[type=module]` is supported.\
No single-file bundles just yet.

### Importing

```ts
// TS-module (pure typescript),
// allows compilation settings to be set from the project config
import { emit, on, off } from 'eventhoven/src';

// ES-module (node, typescript)
import { emit, on, off } from 'eventhoven';

// ESNext (no polyfills for esnext)
import { emit, on, off } from 'eventhoven/dist/esnext';

// ES-module (browser)
import { emit, on, off } from 'https://unpkg.com/eventhoven/dist/es';

// Classic node commonjs
const { emit, on, off } = require('eventhoven/dist/js');
```

### Simple usage examples


<details>
<summary><b>Example 1</b></summary>

```ts
// Essential imports
import { eventMap, emit, on, off } from 'eventhoven';

// Event-map declaration
const emojiEvents = eventMap({
  // key - event name,
  // function arguments - event arguments,
  // function body - default handler for the event
  // (leave emtpy if you need to just declare the event)
  'üë©'(emoji: 'üë®' | 'üë©') {},
  'üåà'(emoji: 'ü¶Ñ' | 'üåß') {},
  'üéå':(emoji: 'üëò' | 'üç£' | 'üöó', amount: number) {},
});

on(emojiEvents)('üéå')(
  (emoji, amount) => console.log(`Yay!, ${amount} of ${emoji}-s from japan!`)
);

on(emojiEvents)('üéå')(
  // Returning promises is also allowed (example API from http://www.sushicount.com/api)
  (emoji, amount) => fetch('http://api.sushicount.com/add-piece-of-sushi/')
    .then(_ => _.json())
    .then(resp => console.log(`Yay!, ${resp.pieces_of_sushi} of ${emoji}-s loaded from sushicount!`))
);

// It's possible to await execution of all event handlers too
await emit(emojiEvents)(
  // Autocomplete for event names here!
  'üéå'
)(
  // Autocomplete for arguments here!
  'üç£', 10
);
// Console output:
// => Yay!, 10 üç£-s from japan!
// => Yay!, 11 üç£-s loaded from sushicount!
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Example 2</b></summary>

```ts
import { eventMap, emit, on, off } from 'eventhoven';

type Todo = { done: boolean; text: string; };

const todos: Todo[] = [];

// Event-map declaration
const todoEvents = eventMap({
  // key - event name,
  // function arguments - event arguments,
  // function body - default handler for the event
  // (leave emtpy if you need to just declare the event)
  'todo-added'(newTodo: Todo, todos: Todo[]) {
    // typically, a default handler is used
    // to compose events from other event managers here
  },
  'done-change'(todo: Todo, newDone: boolean) {},
  'text-change'(todo: Todo, newText: string) {},
});

const unsubFromAddTodo = on(todoEvents)('todo-added')(
  (todo, todos) => todos.push(todo)
);

// `addingTodos` is a promise that resolves
// when all event subscribers are done executing
const addingTodos = emit(todoEvents)('todo-added')(
  { done: false, text: 'new todo' },
  todos
);
// Now, `todos` contains the new todo
```

### `eventMap`

Creates an event-map from event signatures.

**Parameters**:

name | type | description
-----|------|---------------
`events` | [`TEventSignatures`](https://github.com/raiondesu-experiments/eventhoven/blob/master/src/events.ts#L25) | a collection of event signatures

**Returns**: [`TEventMap`](https://github.com/raiondesu-experiments/eventhoven/blob/master/src/events.ts#L8)

This function is the main "entry point" to the whole event management pipeline.
It constructs a base storage for events and their handlers, which is then used by all of the other functions.

In other words, to start working with events in `eventhoven` you start by creating an event-map:
```ts
import { eventMap } from 'eventhoven';

// `keyboardEvents` should now be used for all event interactions
const keyboardEvents = eventMap({
  keyup(e: KeyboardEvent) {},
  keydown(e: KeyboardEvent) {},
  keypress(e: KeyboardEvent, modifier?: string) {
    // This is a default handler for the event,
    // it's always executed when the event is invoked
    console.log('modifier:', modifier);
  },
});
```

In this example, keys in `keyboardEvents` correspond to event names ('keyup', 'keydown', etc.) and values contain handler maps and amount of arguments for a given event.

<details>
<summary>Here, `keyboardEvents`</summary> is equal to the following object:

```ts
const keyboardEvents = {
  // Name of the event
  keyup: {
    // Amount of arguments for the event handlers
    arity: 1,

    // Collection of the event handlers
    handlers: new Map([
      // Notice the default event handler from the event-map
      (e: KeyboardEvent) => {},

      // Do we execute this event handler only once?
      false
    ])
  },
  keydown: {
    arity: 1,
    handlers: new Map([(e: KeyboardEvent) => {}, false])
  },
  keypress: {
    arity: 2,
    handlers: new Map([
      // Notice the default event handler from the event-map
      (e: KeyboardEvent, modifier?: string) => { console.log('modifier:', modifier); },
      false
    ])
  },
}
```
</details>

It's also possible to add new events to the event-map at runtime (by creating a new event-map üòÅ):

```ts
const inputEvents = {
  ...keyboardEvents,
  ...eventMap({
    'mouse-click'(e: MouseEvent) {},
  }),
}

// Still have type inference here!
emit(inputEvents)('mouse-click')
```

const keydown = wait(keyboardEvents)('keydown');

//... some time later in async context

const [e] = await keydown; // Resolves upon the first 'keydown' event emit
console.log(e);
// => KeyboardEvent {}
```
</details>

---

### `harmonicWait`

Same as [`wait`](#wait), but returns a promise factory instead of a plain promise.

> Note, that the function is [curried](#currying), which means that it must be called partially

Useful due to having the same signature as [`emit`](#emit), [`subscribe`](#subscribe) and [`unsubscribe`](#unsubscribe),
which allows for an easier composition of waiters.

```ts
import { wait } from 'eventhoven';

// Function that initiates a waiter
const waitForKeydown = wait(keyboardEvents)('keydown');

//... some time later in async context

// Resolves upon the first 'keydown' event emit
// since the call of the `waitForKeydown`
const [e] = await waitForKeydown();
console.log(e);
// => KeyboardEvent {}
